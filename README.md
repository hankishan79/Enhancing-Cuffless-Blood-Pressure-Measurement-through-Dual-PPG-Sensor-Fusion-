This study introduces a cutting-edge Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based framework for blood pressure prediction, leveraging dual photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. Termed GAT-T (Graph Attention Transformer-Transformer for Blood Pressure Prediction), our model integrates Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Transformer layers to scrutinize PPG signals collected from various body locations. This innovative approach continuously estimates both systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, providing a comprehensive solution for non-invasive and continuous monitoring.
The GAT-T algorithm employs sophisticated pulse wave analysis (PWA) to extract novel hybrid features (1x11 D with PCA components (1x2 D)) from PPG signals, mapping them to precise SBP and DBP values through a data-driven GAT-T model. To assess its effectiveness, the algorithm undergoes rigorous evaluation using a publicly available dataset created at McLean Hospital under Harvard Medical School data usage criteria. For SBP, the algorithm achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.47 mmHg with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.9733 (R2= 0.94). For DBP, it attains an MAE of 1.09 mmHg with a PCC of 0.9595 (R2=0.91).
Our GAT-T model stands as a pioneering advancement in blood pressure monitoring, providing a promising avenue for real-time, non-invasive, and accurate predictions. The integration of GCN architecture with attention mechanisms enhances the model's capacity to capture intricate patterns in PPG signals, contributing to the evolving landscape of health informatics. The findings of this study underscore the potential of GAT-T in revolutionizing blood pressure monitoring methodologies, paving the way for high-impact applications in healthcare.
